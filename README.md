# IPv4 Turf War

It's a game. There's a little webserver. The goal is to access it from
as many IP addresses as you can.

Get creative!

Canonical instance is here: http://108.61.215.240

### How it works

It's a [redbean server](https://redbean.dev/).

```sh
make dev
```

Run `Setup()` in the REPL to prepare the database.
